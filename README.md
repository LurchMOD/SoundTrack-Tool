This project is based on the open-source Music Mod Creation Tool developed by Runite Drill / Utopia, originally designed to support music modding in Paradox Interactive games. The original version can be found at: https://runite-drill.github.io/music-mod-creation-tool/.

This is a heavily modified fork of the original tool, redesigned with expanded functionality, a refined interface, and new capabilities tailored specifically for advanced modding in Paradox titles. While the original tool remains open source, this version will remain private due to the significant changes made and the intended complexity of future updates.

We are planning to evolve this project into a much more advanced and feature-rich tool, supporting more intricate workflows and deeper integration with the modding frameworks used in Paradox games.
